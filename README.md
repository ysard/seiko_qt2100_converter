# Seiko Qt-2100 converter

Seiko converter is a software allowing to generate graphs based on the raw data 
produced by the Seiko Qt-2100 Timegrapher device. 

## Background

By using an interface like the [Libre Printer](https://github.com/ysard/libre-printer) one, 
which can replace a parallel or serial printer, 
you can obtain data as sent by older devices whose printers have unfortunately broken down.

Sometimes old devices cannot be replaced for cost reasons or simply because there is no justification to do so.
However, they often work in pairs with printers that are no longer manufactured and are often the weak point of
the installation because they are prone to breakdowns and the abandonment of the manufacture of their consumables.

## Purpose
The printer linked to the Seiko Qt-2100 chronograph is one of those rare instruments whose
specifications have either never been published or have long been lost.

The specific aim of this project is to process the print data from this device, making it readable, 
usable and printable again according to current modern standards.
